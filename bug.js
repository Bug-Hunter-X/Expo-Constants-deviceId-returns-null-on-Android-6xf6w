This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Constants.deviceId` to retrieve the device's unique identifier.  In certain circumstances, particularly on Android devices, the `deviceId` returns `null` or an empty string, preventing proper device identification and potentially causing issues with features that rely on unique device identifiers. This often happens after installing the app for the first time or after a clean build of the app.
